# QR-Code-Generator-App

This is a simple QR code generator application built using Python's `tkinter` for the GUI, the `qrcode` library for generating QR codes, and the `PIL` (Python Imaging Library) for image processing.

## How to Use

1. Run the Python script.
2. Enter the text or data you want to encode into a QR code into the text entry field.
3. Click the "Generate QR Code" button.
4. The QR code will be displayed in the application's window.

## Code Explanation

The code can be broken down into the following components:

- Import necessary libraries, including `tkinter`, `qrcode`, and `PIL`.
- Define a `QRCodeApp` class that handles the application's functionality.
- Create a method `generate_qr_code` to generate and display the QR code image based on the input text.
- Set up the Tkinter window with labels, an entry field, a button, and an image display area.
- Run the Tkinter main event loop to start the application.

## Dependencies

1. `tkinter`: This library is used for building the graphical user interface.
2. `qrcode`: It is used for generating QR codes.
3. `PIL` (Pillow): This library is used to convert the QR code generated by `qrcode` into an image that can be displayed in the Tkinter window.

## Installation

Before running the script, make sure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using `pip`:

```
pip install qrcode[pil]
```

## Usage

1. Run the script, and a window will appear.
2. Enter the text you want to encode in the "Enter text to generate QR code" entry field.
3. Click the "Generate QR Code" button.
4. The generated QR code will be displayed in the window.
